                            <p>Urban Shred was born in 2015 in a garage in Los Angeles by a crew of street skaters who were tired of overpriced, underperforming boards. We wanted to create something different - premium quality at honest prices.</p>
                            <p>Starting with just a handful of deck designs, we've grown into a full-line skateboard company. But we've never forgotten our roots. Every product we make is tested by our team riders in the streets and parks of LA.</p>
                            <p>Today, Urban Shred is trusted by skaters around the world, from beginners learning their first ollie to pros throwing down in competitions. We're here to support your progression, whatever your style.</p>
